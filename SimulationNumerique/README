#### HOW TO USE THE CODE ####

1- In a terminal, go to directory SimulationNumerique ; launch Julia (> julia). You are now in the REPL

2- Execute > include("includeFile.jl")
	This will install the different packages required for the program, and ensure that they
	are uptodate
	It will also include the packages inside the REPL ; so it is required to execute this line for every new julia REPL

3- Execute > include("main.jl")
	First time will be slow, next times will be much faster
